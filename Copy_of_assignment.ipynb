        "1. Not enough effort has been put into making data cleaning an easy and efficient process. The abstract highlights that tidy datasets have a specific structure that makes them incredibly easy to use. It leverages a small set of tools to make a huge impact on data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard is intended to easily strucutre data sets to make them effective and efficient for future analysis. It is a standardized process of organizing values and using tools to save time and labor when completeing the process.\n",

        "3. The first sentence is attempting to clarify that easy messy data set comes with its own unique set of problems; however, when a data set is tidy, it shares a unique set of principles and common themes as all other tidy data sets. The second phrase idenitifies that it is often east to identify certain aspects of a data set and catagorize them but what many people struggle to understand is the meaning and casue behind each aspect of the dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined as a standard way of mapping a dataset's meaning to its structure. Tidy data has each variable forming a column, each observation forming a row, and each observational unit forming a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with data sets are:\n",
        "    - Column headers are values when they should be variable names instead\n",
        "    - Multiple varaibles are stored in one column when it should just one variable per column\n",
        "    - Variables are stored in both rows and columns. They should only be in columns\n",
        "    - Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. There should be seperate data sets for seperate groups.\n",
        "    - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. This is repetitive and confusing for those using the data.\n",
        "  In Table 4, since income is the variable mainly being measured here, the columns need to be based on the the names of variables, rather than the values of the variable.\n",
        "  Melting a dataset involves converting column variables into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Table 11 has different days as columns when they are values and not variables. Table 12 combines the values into a single variable called date. However, the element column contains measurements of the same unit and not values. Table 12(b) has all columns that are all different attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. The chicken and the egg problem is that data is only as useful as the tools that work with it and tidy tools are linked to the tidy data. Breaking away from this involves creating larger networks of knowledge on how to use the tools available. Human factors and user-centered design can contribute to forming this network."
